Brother of legendary Bidley. Not as harsh and lucky, Jeremy loves fun, brewages and beautiful women. He has a thing for weapons, and collects all the newest inventions. A shot thunder is more pleasing for him than any music. Crewmen say that he is able to kill a gull a hundred feet away from a cannon.
