While being an experienced pirate, Andal did not always consider himself as a mage or a rogue. He was an ordinary merchant until bankrupting and getting too many debts one day. He started searching for a way to get fast and easy money. After leaving his home, he shortly returned as a known smuggler. He usually trades gems and mountain crystals. It is a mystery where he gets them from, however.
