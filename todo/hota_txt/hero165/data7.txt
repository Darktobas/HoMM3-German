Eovacius never learnt magic. All his magical talent was inborn. He was raised in a maritime city where he used his talent to steal on the markets. He became a prosperous and influential man until he got too many annoying and powerful rivals in the government. After that the natural born mage left his homeland and chose the life of a pirate.
