Message:
My name is Manfred, I'm one of the best fire mages. At least, I try to be. I come from nomadic people who have never had a home. I had to leave my tribe to learn magic.		However, the legends of my people tell of the legendary Desert Fire, where no soldier dared to go. There, the earth itself breathes with heat and fiery creatures seep through the fabric of space in our world. If I can conquer the fiery desert, I will gain expertise of fire magic. But if I hesitate, the land will kill me with its breath. By my calculations, I can survive in this hell for no longer than two months.

Message:
Today I met the first living person in this desert. A nomad as he told me, talked about an old goblin settlement. It is located in the east near the oasis.	Great news!

Name:
Day 8
Message:
The main challenge for me is to conquer the desert. Apparently, the creatures from the Plane of Fire cause strong perturbations of space. I have to destroy them or subdue their will. The space will calm down and the energy flow will normalize.

Name:
Day 12
Message:
I realized that in this hell we need to save not only water, but also people. Not that many brave souls dare to enter these lands.

Name:

Message:
I must hurry. Every day it becomes more and more difficult for me to protect the body from the withers.

Name:
