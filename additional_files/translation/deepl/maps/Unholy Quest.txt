I have gathered my things and await a ship. I will not go below ground ever again. You will have to kill me or I will swim for it, but I shall never join such a crazy quest!

Leave me be. I have just broke free from the underworld. I ran into this forest to hide. The only help below are the remains of the living - seek their bones for they still fight to free their souls.

Message:
Welcome, we have been awaiting your arrival. Most will wish to join your cause, but there are a few in the castles that are scared and would rather die by your blade then return to the underworld. Let us go forth and take all that we need to cleanse the world.

We have been training long and hard for such a quest, but still we are not sure if we should join those that have fought along side of the dead. Let us think.
