A New Day Tomorrow

===== Map description =====
Every lord in these lands has his own reasons for waging war. It's futile to expect mercy from any of them, and the land itself is full of dangers, unwilling to part with its riches. However, keep in mind that one defeat doesn't mean all is lost. It'll be a new day tomorrow.

Name:
Tempestus 1
Message:
War. Arguably the most devastating calamity to befall a country. Lords tend to seek for tiniest reasons to wage it. They want to enhance their power, to gain more land, to restore their dignity, or simply to beat boredom. You were of the power hungry kind, but struck out quickly, which proved to be a fortunate occurrence. An old friend of yours got you resettled here, in Tempestus, where he hoped for you to get a new start. War. This is how your new home is. Battles never cease here, they only get more cruel after a monarch dies. Tempests never stop at all. You were lucky enough to get a decent head start to settle down without anyone disturbing you, thanks to your friend's connections. It would be wise to send scouts in every direction, as it is crucial to be prepared for foul surprizes the unwelcoming land has in the works.

Name:
The Old Extate 1
Message:
The concept of a huge empire has one major flaw. It is always going to fall, that is. Every kid in the New Extate is aware of what happened there recently, but not a single learned man can offer an explanation to that. Some kind of magic went in action to raise a number of snow covered isles from the seas. Soon, the continent broke down in separate parts. This made for poor army logistics, but a war erupted nonetheless. The king was said to be a brave leader, but perhaps too brave to keep his troops alive. His advisors, initially warmongering, started pushing for peace. A treaty was signed, and the new territories assumed the title of the New Extate. You are working in the interests of the Old Extate, but in order to avoid a new full-scale war, you will be acting as an independent. Your land wants your service, but it will disown you, should you fail.

Name:
The New Extate 1
Message:
Funny how one day can set everything flying bottoms up. A small gaffe by a mighty sorcerer was enough to tear a big plot of land off your old homeland and bring it here. Magic can be a terrible thing when you make mistakes, and thus the sorcerer himself and thousands of people who lived in the lands struck by the calamity perished. As if this was not enough, the king of a land called the Extate, neighboring those parts, declared on the newcomers. He wasn't sure whether they wanted war or peace, and decided to act first, and in a violent way. And so he lost. It is rumored that he fled the country, and his advisors pretend to be happy with the ceasefire that followed. Don't expect it to last for long. You must settle quickly, but the borders of the New Extate shouldn't be your limits. Who knows what will come to you if you explore a bit?

Name:
The Nether Extate 1
Message:
There used to be only a few mines and camp towns in this subterranean region. However, after the Silent ones came, the land was changed on a whim. They arrived soon after the New Extate came to be. They aren't too friendly, and their powers are scary, but they brought a lot over a few months. Actually, enough for starting dreaming of big things. Lords of the Nether newer commanded much respect, and few even realized there were any people living beneath the great Extate. Today, many became hopeful of getting big things done, including you and your rival lord from a neighboring town. Be wary and smart in using your resources!

Name:
Acropia 1
Message:
The land was named after the city of Acropia that used to stand tall. It was home to a group of druids who were planning on bringing change to the world. Acropia was reduced to a mere fort after its governess betrayed the great city. Tempestus, the land sitting above us, was razed in a catastrophe, and it it didn't take long for marauders from there to arrive. The Senate decided against fortifying the city to repel them. The raiders were offered a payoff, and they landed nearby. No big surprise they plundered the city soon anyway, and all the greenery the druids were tending to was exterminated. You are hailing from those who died defending their land, and it's your duty to help rebuild it now. Some wretch from a castle nearby is said to be looking at this possibility too. Likely one of the barbarians who razed Acropia, he's now plotting to claim the great city's fame. It will be wise to act carefully for now.	

Name:
Tempestus, Acropia 2
Message:
First scouts to return report the following. You shouldn't be hoping for a warm welcome here. An abandoned town, formerly famous, was located North from here. Impenetrable swamps occupy the lands to the South. Some warriors currently unattached to any lord can be found there.

Name:
The Extate 2
Message:
Scarce news from your scouts so far.	They've found an ancient town to the West, which was no small feat. Looks like mercenaries are its only inhabitants these days. The castle to the North, the one that used to be a domain of the Extate, is neutral for now, but this isn't likely to last.

Name:
Broken Blade
Message:
The next scouting squad had a lot to report.	There is a three-sided conflict in the center of the region, involved are three fortresses, of which neither is held by your enemies so far. You should consider the possibility of exploiting that land's riches, but you'll need to accumulate a considerable force first.	Pirates have been located nearby as well, likely the ones who used to control the continent earlier. Some Faerie Dragon nests have been found there as well, but the beasts aren't allied with the sea dogs anymore.	Broken Blade to the West of Tempestus is probably the biggest place of interest. The war has ravaged it nearly clean, but there are still some battling to control it. The reason for that is likely the Azure Dragons inhabiting the place.

Name:
Agamonde, Ilyane's Fist
Message:
The newest scouts to arrive look rather tattered.	There are mysterious portals in the region, orange and purple, but it was only speculated before where those could be leading. Now, Agamonde behind the orange one is home to wights and fel knights. This kingdom, once powerful, was reduced to nearly nothing after necromancers and pirates joined their forces to attack it. There was the Agamonde Tournament going on nearby at the time, but its participants were in no rush to help the hosts. The Tournament is still being held, but a participant from Agamonde itself is hard to encounter these days.	The purple portal is the only way to get to Iliane's Fist. The foreigner woman brought the dungeon folk to prosperity, and this curious place now bears her name. Every Finger of Ilyane's Fist is full of treasure, but much trial awaits the claimant. You will be able to pick your opponent there, just like at the Agamonde Tournament.

My dream is to have a real dragon to ride! Honestly, horses bore me to tears. Just imagine me, so handsome, sitting on its back, all shiny and crimson... yeah, I'd like a Crystal one, is it a bad thing or something? So here's the deal, I don't have enough crystals to afford it at the time. That said, I'm going on a trip soon, and I'll get me one! Get me the crystals I need. There are a few Dwarf Treasuries nearby, you can rob them for all I care.
This isn't enough. I need no fewer than 5. Get lost.
Soon, very soon I'll be riding my dragon! No king nor knight could ever have dreamt of it. Take this in return, I hope you can put it to good use.

Please, just don't ask how we got here. They might as well start offering tours of my place. Actually, that would still be better than what we got here when we arrived.	I'm afraid I must ask you for assistance. I need a few crystals every now and then for my research. It wasn't hard to obtain them until the water separated my home from their source. I don't want to help the greedy gnomes get even richer, buying from them. Would you perchance have a few to spare?

Selling tours doesn't sound that bad to me anymore. "A foreigner's home", "An Alchemist from down under", "A hut of mysteries" - doesn't this sound cool?	Got the crystals, by the way?

I used to run a very successful workshop before those rapscallions, now calling themselves the New Extate, fell upon us. I was a self-made businessman, and there was no one like me in the whole land! Now that the war's been upon us, there's little demand for my gems, as new craftsmen took the market share. My son has a short temper, and he demands we just go and literally kick them out of business, but I think we could start something new. I have a reason to think I'll do well in alchemy, too. I just need a bit of an investment to start. Could you help?

I've been on hard times ever since our continent broke up. Ole Alfgend and I were tending to the Star Axis, when one day we woke up to see the sea out of our window instead of the usual mountains. We were lucky to survive, but my friend didn't look too happy. He became unstable, then he grabbed his staff and his pet, and ran off. I coldn't follow, but I heard Alfgeng is now living near the frozen river to the East. It's hard to get there, and the old man has gone mad after weeks of roving the frozen waste. These days he sees everyone as a demon, and he is willing to defend his last friend. Please, end my friend's suffering and bring me his pendant. I will share some of my wisdom with you for that.
Is it so hard to find a deranged mage these days? The one tending to a rooster near the frozen river?
I hope my friend would forgive me for doing this to him. I don't suppose you could bring us back from where we came, so your job's done. Would you like to study now?

I am old, and I'll probably never set my foot outside anymore. I'm not to disclose the details of the mission me and my kin were charged with. In the days of yore those who left the Order met a quick death. Those who made the laws understood why it was so important to keep everything secret. They were probably right in that.	But I just can't resist. My life that's about to end was full of adventure, but also of pain and loneliness. I don't know how my brothers are doing, or even what's the world like outside this hell hole.	I can't lay my secret on a random passer-by. On no one, really; but it wouldn't be so shameful to relay my knowledge on a venerable warrior, I guess.

Our Order, which name you don't need to know, is not only for knights and priests. I'd even say there are not many of those among our numbers. This organization began operations before humans even stopped dragging their knuckles.	You must have heard of demons possessing other creatures, becoming the masters of their thoughts and actions. So our Order works on recognizing the demonic voices. Our people stand behind most every king or abbot, which helped to avoid wars and massacres countless times.	You probably understand now how important it is to keep this in secret. The demons are already aware of our talents, but they don't yet realize the scale of our Order's operations. However, they've accomplished a few things already, and they already can act nearly freely around these parts.	I don't know what exactly they are after, and where to start searching. I only beg you to stay vigilant on your way. 	Here, this relic will probably help you in your journeys.

Welcome to the Helix, o stranger. Do you like how the island is shaped? Well, the nature is tricky, but it wouldn't be able to make something like this on its own. It's us, the mercenary mages, we sunk parts of this land to create an impenetrable stronghold for the corsairs! Ones who'd like to grab their treasure would have to wander the desert for days, or fight their way on water through two garrisons. Yeah, we were bright like this.	 Now it's all gone. The pirates poked something powerful and scary, and they got basically blown off the isle. My magi brothers were even less lucky, as they're doomed to roam the land, deformed, for countless ages. Or before someone ends their suffering Find them in the deep of the Helix. I'll gift you something to make you wise beyond words if you manage to do that. You might be able to sink continents with that.
Haven't you found them yet? Come on, they're hard to pass. They're probably somewhere near the fort where the corsairs used to keep their supplies.
Yes, I feel my brothers aren't suffering anymore. Or not. I'm not, that's for sure. Here, handle this with care!

It's not very nice to barge into a home and wake up its owner. Back in the day I'd shoot you. Or turn you into an otter. Somehow it was always an otter.	Well, you woke me, not shot me, which probably means you're not so bad. Someone new for change. I'm tired of walking deaders and blockheads who lose their mind after seeing the island's new inhabitants.	Before them horse riders arrived, we were the doom of the Tattered Sea. Everyone seeked our friendship, as there was no use in fighting us. We could send a huge force from the Helix anywhere and kick anyone's arse. We were building our future while a bunch of idiots was pushing each other around the Broken Blade.	Everything was lost because of that damned Slynt. His squadron found some ancient thingamabob, but they had no idea what was that, and were stupid enough to bring it here. Soon the flying death came. It's impossible to bring everything back, and I won't ask for that. Just one thing. Slay the dog who doomed us. I can barely breath when I remember he escaped. My last bullet is for him; or for myself, as I can't see myself ever getting out of here. Will you grant me this last wish? Do Slynt in, and I'll give you the thing that was keeping me alive all these years.
I don't think Slynt got any smarter. Try searching for him in the North.
Aye, these were good thirty or forty years, maybe longer. Just some crappy last months. Some will say that was my fate; but I don't think the old hag wants anything to do with me. We build and destroy our lives with our own hands, then we hack our way through enemy rows and lay important matters on blockheads.	Dang, forgive the geezer's ravings. That's quite enough of that. This thingy didn't make me want to live, but it kept me alive. It's probably serve you better. Now begone, I've got things to do.

The Helix knew better times, that's for sure. I once ran a laboratory here, along with a smithy. A captain once came to me; said he wanted a gold cannon. He loved luxury, he did. So I gilded him a gun, and this wise ass blew my fingers off! I had to cast him a real one. Of course, the wheels wouldn't roll, the four of them had to drag it to the ship. So, they somehow managed to take some town, but the cannon wouldn't fire. He would have probably chopped off my hand for that, but on their way back it broke the ship's bottom.	 What am I doing here? Well, nearly everyone of our syndicate is gone, but that's no good reason to stop our research. I would have caught those critters that started appearing here myself, but they seem to be magical. They come suddenly, and then they go at once. But I heard they can even be hired somewhere in the dungeons to the east. I don't know what do they need gold for. Neither do I need it, though. I'll gladly part with it if you do this tricky job for me.
Sorry, but I need at least six heads... gobs... individuals! I have big plans for them.
Yes, now I'll find out who they are and where they come from. And if not, at least I'll not get bored for a while.

Down, you nincompoop. Some nerve on your side to poke around here! But so be it, I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself. My troops attempted to take Broken Blade many times. Apparently, something important is being held there, but I still haven't figured out what exactly! I can't return empty-handed. Here's the job. Go smash those damned women that turned my idiot soldiers into chopped liver. It's useless to try our luck again while they're still there.
Don't you take me for a fool, you haven't killed the Nagas at Broken Blade!
While you were gone, my spies brought news. It seems that Broken Blade is a desolate, icy wilderness where terrible dragons live. You island savages aren't easy to understand; and I must understand my enemy. All right, your job's done. Take this and be glad I didn't turn you into stinking fog.

Welcome, make yourself comfortable, but not for long. I don't have much time to sit around and lounge; we are at war! Everyone wants to retake our land to the East these days! But Broken Blade is the symbol of my race, who else would fit better for the job? My ancestor was a famed Pegasus rider, he sank armadas and crushed hordes with one sweep of his blade, that's how he was! His name was lost over centuries, unfortunately. You can help restore the justice. Drive the steel riders away from the river, and I'll give you something in reward. Us elves have plenty of relics.

It's hard to believe this withered land once was a trading haven, isn't it? Now I'm the last one to have some kind of an enterprise around here; and there's no one to inherit it after I'm gone. One day, a foreign mercenary destroyed our future. I don't know who he was or where he went after, or whether he knew what he was doing. But I know exactly who hired him. He and his cronies are wandering near an abandoned mine to the west, turned into... something else. Their filthy lives are my price for the passage.

I never thought I would be happy someone died. Twice. You have succeeded with this, so I reckon you won't do worse with my chickens. Now I can go. I heard the druids transformed a nothing island in the west into a real wonder! A traveler can find rest there, and a warrior, good fortune! Although the latter is up to debate.

So you think you're strong enough to beat every misfortune? Magic brought might to our land, and that, in turn, destroyed it in a matter of days. Silly to think this can't happen to your home. Assess your strength wisely, but do trust your intuition sometimes... Yes, I'm just another old fool with some scary stories, but nothing useful. Come back when you're ready. I'll tell you what to worry about before you step into the portals behind my hut.
Come back after you're level 5, no less!
You're quick to come back. Nothing is as easy to find these days as a foe. However, there won't be one beyond the portals. You will get to where tournaments are held. Armies, large and small, will stand up to the brave fortune seeker, but the reward is worth it all. You aren't guaranteed to live; you may beat the guards and then be crushed by another adventurer like you. There are also towns out there. The purple portal leads to where minotaurs, dragons and other underground folk dwell, and the orange, to the shadow of a former human kingdom, where only zombies and skeletons waddle around now.

And what did you expect from a gang of pirates, that they'd build a garrison with hordes of guards? They hastily threw up a shabby tower and left me alone in it. A dog taught to pass the keys would do no worse. They left for the Helix, and I never saw them again. I think I've been here long enough by now. I'll share what I've got here with you, for a service. The Efreeti have awakened several volcanoes in the north of the island, which is bad for my business. They ought to be driven away.

I used to be a field surgeon until recently. There always was a steady supply of enemies, and a steadier one of cripples. I witnessed the rise of Acropia, visited the Old Extate, when it was still called simply the Extate, and I took part in the liberation of the Three Fortresses. I can't wield a bow or a sword anymore, and I won't be even offering healing for much longer. All this thanks to a creature that sucks youth out of its prey. Some like that live dangerously close to here. Sail to the south and pacify the undead!

Now no one else will suffer the fate that befell me. But think about it, no one's dragging me along with some military expedition now, either. I'm free to go anywhere, and now I may visit an old friend, a human who was always kind to everyone. I haven't seen him for some 130 years. Oh, humans tend to not live that long, do they?	 This thing didn't help me, but maybe it'll be of use to you.

My father is dying... After the tragedy in Agamonde, he was considered hopelessly sick and forced to march on the forefront. He survived miraculously, and we crossed the sea afterwards for the healing waters of this place. But the disease won't back down, as too much time has passed.	 They say an elven field surgeon on the island nearby owns a Vial of Lifeblood, which was the last trophy in the Tournament of Agamonde. Perhaps you'll be lucky enough to find one like that somewhere else. If it can heal him, I'll give you everything. Please, do find it, and in the meantime I'll try to ask the monks in the south for help.

You noticed a glowing pendant, shaped like a cross, among the corpses in an inconspicuous corner. These must be the knights that were heading for the Black Mountains. But why was such a valuable thing left behind by the murderers? The realization came later than it should: some of the dead were clearly fresher than the others. You are not the first to come here searching for this thing. And now the trap worked once again.

Hey, you're rather tough after all. You could be of use to us. Since the guys accepted me, they'll be fine with you as well! Yes, I wasn't always one of them. Once I was a respected person in Agamonde, but I was dragged into debt. I didn't want to sell the house, so I sold my servants into slavery. Only for the sake of the family, I swear! And then they threw me in the jail, and heck knows whether I'd ever be out, if my new friends didn't come. They took me in, and I provided them with some information. Isn't family more important than everything else! Over time, my knowledge proved useful when sieging other cities, as I used to travel a lot. I was even put in charge of my own ship in due time. Now, after I got wounded, I became an advisor. I always thought about my family, and that's why I escaped them Agamond fools! I hope we'll meet again, tough guy.

Of course, most of the guards were mercenaries, but there were some regular soldiers of Agamonde, and some others who'd be willing to help. But the monks in control of the second gate wouldn't let the messenger through. "If Agamonde is destined to fall, then fall it shall", they said. Now, I'd love to see how willing they are to meet their own destiny. They abandoned the Tournament and went to spread their wisdom elsewhere. Don't let them escape.

My father was right to not believe in me. "He'll do good, but stay dumb!" - he would say. When the New Extate fell on us, I was afraid to even go near there at first, but father said I was a disgusting coward and sent me alone to scout. I was caught, but the guys there were nice. They taught me some simple magic. Instead of information I brought new friends. They were executed, and I was told to cut the nonsense. The New Extate is full of enemies; I was very fortunate not to be executed along with them. I am grateful to father for that. The war dragged on for a long time. Our noble house lost almost all mercenaries, and my father and I nearly avoided death a few times. We managed to reach the castle. The truce greatly angered my father. He realized that I'd now rush to learn from neighbors when I should be working on becoming a warrior. After some time, we were forced to leave the house, but we had no ship. I had to summon one, and soon we settled in this place. Every day I go fishing on my modest magic boat. My father grumbles that I should be conjuring up a fleet to crush the New Extate, if I were really that smart. He recently heard about a place where warriors can show off, the Ring of Abundance. He wants me to go there and bring back bounty. But I can't even deal with the Efreeti guarding the portal that leads there! Perhaps you could help? And then I'd try to do the rest myself.

What is the place of knowledge in our world? Oh, I can tell you everything about that! Bear with a lonely old man for a while, traveler, do not rush. I had the honor of knowing the former King of the Extate. He was a worthy man, brave in battle, and spiritual. Everything changed after the snow strangers arrived suddenly. Who were they? What did they need here? The lords of the court decided they could tackle the conquerors. But those were not like the gnolls and troglodytes of earlier days. They waited, displaying no aggression. The King himself led the troops against the new neighbor in search of answers. After a series of battles it became clear that newcomers preferred fighting with magic, and they didn't have many churches. Despite the losses, the King bravely led the troops on, but at one point he found himself alone. He returned from captivity bringing conditions of peace. Lords of the Extate yielded, but the king never forgave the foreigners for this offense. Are you ready to learn the end of this story?

Lords of the Extate yielded, but the king never forgave the foreigners for this offense. Are you ready to learn the end of this story?
So what is the place of knowledge in our world after all? Now the former King of the Extate is exiled. What was his mistake? If not courage and spirituality, then what should a good monarch striving for? I think knowledge is what he lacked. People of the New Extate did not want to come here, they did not want war. Ignorance dragged the king into battle. Ignorance of his neighbor's culture turned a religious person into a fanatic. Ignorance turned a courageous warrior into a reckless idiot who brought his companions to death. In order for you avoid mistakes, I'll give you the necessary knowledge. Behind the portals nearby lie lands suitable for the brave ones. Tournaments that take place there require participants of an unprecedented skill. Moreover, those lands are now also at war. Show courage, but also caution, when stepping there. The orange portal will send you to Agamonde, the former stronghold of people, purple - to the Fist of Ilyane, which is underground. And the king was never seen again after he left his beloved home. But I'm sure he's very sorry for everything he's done.

I always preferred to do my business honestly. Tit for tat, as they say. It was also very important to honor old connections. Unfortunately, this way of dealing with things is going out of fashion. My brother was captured by demons who were fighting our ally at Broken Blade. Now, instead of attempting to rescue the prisoners, our ally is crying for more help. I'm now forced to ask you to rescue my brother and our men. He's being held somewhere under a volcanic island, in the far North.

After a calamity befell our town, I was made a sentryman on a rock nearby. It wasn't a hard task, but I managed to fail it. This beast, Ojzin, came from the swamp and made me flee my hideout! Drive him away so I can carry on with my service, and to prove you did it, bring my Sentinel figurine he's turned into a toy. Hopefully, not much has happened there since i left; it's a quiet place.
Haven't you found him yet, you nincompoop? He's hiding in the swanp near the rocks.
Yes, I've already heard the word of your accomplishment. I was already going to hire a griffin and pour some magical concoction on him from above. I hope it wasn't too hard to deal with it? I'll share some knowledge with you, but don't expect anything on top of that.

Greetings. You found this place, which means you're worthy of knowing its history. My family was keeping this once beautiful land for generations, but after the surface foreigners came, it became what you see now. Alas, I wasn't able to prevent the decay singlehandedly, but you could become my ally, couldn't you? Graft was seen near the Acropian waste recently. He is the lap dog of those responsible for everything you see here. End him and bring me the trinket he carries around all the time. Then we'll restore this land.
Don't you fret, Graft will meet his fate soon. He must be hiding somewhere near Acropia.

Well, you're here already, you might as well come in. One more for the Ring of Abundance. Yeah, that's what it was called back in the day. The mines were huffing and puffing, me and my Nighon buddies were collecting "voluntary" taxes. So you come one day, and the peasants are like "a dragon took our sulfur". Yeah, right, as if there ever was a dragon this smart. Anyway, I'd give the beast some sleeping herbs, and in the meantime harpies would come and steal our stuff... Well, I always carried a mace for these situations... erm, where was I? I say, you're stupid to poke around here, searching for all those Hydras and Behemoths. Knowledge is the real power! I wish I met someone as good as myself, then I'd pass my tricks on to him. Like, when a dragon comes and steals your stuff, what do you do? Me and my buddies would come and take it back from the stupid beast. I was in charge of security, that means I was to put the dragon to sleep while the others took their stolen stuff. Well, I had a mace, too, just in case. Them dragons aren't that smart.
You probably won't be able to understand my wisdom. Well, I can tell you how to put a dragon to sleep instead. Them beasts aren't that smart!
All right, finally, someone I can teach to put dragons to sleep! They aren't that smart, y'know. Oh, and take this mace, too, just in case.

Hail, traveler. You must have encountered the bane of this village already. The northern barbarians. I was sent here on an important mission. We will make the river impassable and cut them off. They won't be able to get away, and then they'll starve! One mine is a small price to pay for our security. The only problem is their huge birds who are patrolling the lake and the river all day and night through. Help us get rid of them.
Weird that you haven't found the birds yet. They must be somewhere around the river or the lake.
I can now finalize the ritual and end this threat. You served our land well, and here's your well-deserved reward. We hope to see you again!

A new mug is always nice to see. Would you mind helping an old necromancer out? I badly need a Nighon dragon, there must be ones like that around. I have no idea what they need their wings for if they live underground. Then I want a big, clumsy lizard. Lastly, a pretty green dragon. Why? I just love them criters, that's why. A reward? You can take my pets instead, I don't have much use for them anymore. Deal?
No, you blockhead! A green one, a red one, and a lizard, nothing less, nothing more!
So beautiful, so strong! What wondrous material. Here, have my pets, as we agreed.

Down, you nincompoop. You will do an important mission for me. One of my idiot officers was on a recon mission between Agamonde and the Extate, and the elves got him. He better not disclose any classified information before you get him out of there; and you better do. Dismissed.

Good job, you're not as useless as my brainless subordinates. Here's your reward.

Every surface lordling is trying to seize what we created these days. The tournament on the Fist of Ilyane was meant to forge new alliances, but instead we got new greedy idiots. They lost the army to their negligence; now they're returning with new forces, but now they're our enemies. Why bother keeping peace with warlocks, right? Sometimes we even get people who come to avenge those who came to avenge someone themselves. I wonder if this will ever end. Preventing things like that is my job. Recently, a warrior barely managed to defeatt the guard of Littlefinger, our first garrison. Out of his army only a squad of djinns survived. They are still pondering further plans. They might not be planning on doing anything bad, but I have to follow the instructions. Get rid of them, and I'll take care of the reward.

The commanders of Ilyane's Fist assigned a bannerman to get rid of foreigners who were squatting in the south. He considered it low to get his hands dirty in a matter like that, and he passed the order down to my mentor who, in turn, charged me with the matter. Now I'm asking a favour of you, my friend. I'll do away with many, but the unicorns with their damned resistance will shrug my spells off. Obviously, you may recruit someone to do this in your stead, too.

You probably understand who'll get the full reward for our exploits. Not to worry; I've got something personally for you.

We vowed to protect our land, but we can't stand up to the evil that lurks here anymore. Stupid folk believes the southerner that rules us now is a clever and fair man. What's so fair in that his guard is paid better than anyone else? Aren't we all soldiers of our motherland? All those enterprises he founded here, it's all just a screen. Very soon he will slaughter everyone in the night, when he doesn't need us anymore. Today, you have the honor to restore justice. He is negotiating with long-ears from the west. There's much less guard at the chapel than in the castle. Don't miss this chance!

We will recover from the disasters he shed upon us in due time. We swore to protect the land, and from now on we will also guard the justice here! The oath is given!

These days everyone's concerned about the orcs in the north of the island. "Destroy them, drive them out!" is all you hear. Until recently they were the only neighbors of me and my friend here. Those "bloodthirsty savages" were happy to help in my garden for a small fee, they also brought delicious fruit from the south. And now, after the "civilized people" arrived, I only get what the peasants can collect, and nobody wants to aid the "orc lover". Unfortunately, my friend also left me, but he promised to pay me a visit. What would I ask of you, traveler? Your company is enough. Tell me about yourself, about your home, about the wonders you've met in your journeys. Maybe I'll tell you something useful too.
