Monk's Retreat

===== Rumors =====

===== Timed events =====

Name:
Monks are still around.
Message:
As you start out to conquer the region, you hear rumors that the monks who used to rule are still barricaded somewhere on their home islands.  If you could get into those areas and plunder all the gold and artifacts the monks have taken over the years, it could help in your fight against the other lords.

Name:
Monks guarding burial grounds.
Message:
Scouts report the monks are guarding underground burial tombs.  This would explain why they fell back to these areas.  It also makes your eyes light up with the all the possible resources and artifacts that might be buried down there.

Name:
Valley of the Clover
Message:
You overhear from a passing merchant that there are vast riches in the Valley of the Clover, but because the monks are guarding it, he couldn't get in to see for himself.

Name:
Valley of Mists
Message:
Some adventurers tell you of the Valley of Mists and all the wealth and artifacts hidden in the dense clouds.  Unfortunately, the monks guard it all so getting to it would be a big problem.

Name:
Valley of Clay
Message:
You find a book on a nearby island where the "Valley of Clay" is located.  The book tells of the rich flora and fauna on this island and also of the riches to be had there.  Unfortunately, like the other valleys, monks heavily guard it.
