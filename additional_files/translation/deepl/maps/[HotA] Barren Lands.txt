Yes, I am the hero who can walk on water. And if you want, I can teach you how to do that but it costs a lot.I need a good army to wander again. Only Azure Dragons are accepted. I think you won't refuse to help me and give me 6 Azure Dragons.
I don't need any warriors but Azure Dragons. Or you will never know how to walk on water.
You found 6 Azure Dragons! Well, I will go conquer the cities and you can try to walk on water.

We are local woodcutters and we've got a delivery order for 1000 wood. We've already cut nearly a half when we suddenly found the Tree of Knowledge. We tried to cut it many times but everything was in vain. Many of us died in this damned forest. We won't return there. If you help us to get 576 wood we need, we will provide you good warriors.
It's not enough. I need 576 wood or the delivery order won't be completed.
Finally! Hope you cut down all this damned forest. Well, give me 576 wood and you will get something.
