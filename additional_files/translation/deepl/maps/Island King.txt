Message:
The king has suddenly died without having designated an heir.  He leaves seven sons, all the same age and each born from a different wife in the late king's harem.  Each son feels entitled to the throne, and there is no love lost between them.  Their rivalry has quickly heated up to a battler age as the princes gather their supporters and rally them to their causes. The kingdom will surely fragment if the issue of the succession is not decided soon.

This gold mine is very dangerous inside.  The guards eye you dubiously but agree to let you by when you have achieved the experience level 11.
The guards here simply will not permit anyone below level 11 to pass.
