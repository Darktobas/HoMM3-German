Nachricht:
Ship wreckage and lifeless scenery around were the only things one could see from the shore after the disaster. The survivors were constantly stressed as the area frightened them with its silence. No bird, or animal, or any other living things, but only a soft sound of a river could be heard. Even a wind could bring no relief, the air here was soaked with the smell of fumes, and slowly fading clouds of smoke and ash were seen around.

Name:
Player - Start 2
Nachricht:
Pretty soon after you gathered what remained of your provision, some ships under red flags appeared on the horizon. One of the smaller ships moored, and then a group of demons who had been on the ship, landed and scattered in different directions. With only the few ones left from your crew, any warrior counts, so there is no use in fighting the demons now. You have to find any shelter or {fortifications to defend} from demons as soon as possible, and also {gather everything most necessary for us}.

A band of demons got on your scent, so you have no time. You only have to run, but do not get too far from them as you can make some use of the ungathered resources in the future.

Name:
Player - 1
Nachricht:
Every year the demons who live in these lands go for a hunt for different underground and swamp creatures to have fun and get some resources. During the hunt they compete each other, and different clans start to kill each other because of trophies they cannot share. But in the local tavern they say that this time a prey has a plan to become a hunter – the creatures demons hunted for so long, have chosen their mighty chiefs who united them.

Name:
Player - 2
Nachricht:
Only few weeks left before the Carnival of the Abyss starts, and that means bloody chaos unleashing upon these lands very soon. Every side would try to defeat other ones, and you seem to be right in the center of these events. You cannot leave this land that easy as the navy of the demons patrols the sea around these lands and is supported from the land. You have either to capture the local centers of production, or to raise it.

Name:
Player - 3
Nachricht:
Judging on the movements starting nearby, the Carnival of the Abyss have already started, so you need to prepare your troops to the battle. The attacks will be stronger every time, so you should be ready to flee. They say the underground lords are to attack in a week approximately. Maybe it is a good idea to strike them first before they do anything?

The main forces of demons arrived, so you have nearly no time left. There is still possibly a hope for success…

Hello.I’ve heard you fight local demons, and they master powerful magic, right? Well, I have Recanter’s Cloak, and I’m ready to give it to you if you complete three tasks for me. I need a lot of resources for my experiments in magic, so these will be your first task. I will tell you about the other quests later.
Not enough. Please don’t waste our time.
That’s good. Ok, let’s pass to the second quest.
Now I don’t want anyone bother me, so you are to find the good guards for me, preferably local ones.
Er?
Great! So, the last task.
I don’t need the cloak; it would only prevent me from experimenting. But the armor only weakening the magic would be useful. I don’t want to burn myself, you know…
Any success?
I hope you aren’t angry at my huge requests. But deal is the deal. Now the cloak is yours.

Right before the monolith a strange silhouette was standing, whispering unstoppably something undecipherable. When you got closer to him, he fell silent, and in a moment started talking again, but now you could understand every word: “Anyone who needs to go through must offer a little part of what he acquired…”

Wow! Could it happen that someone who needs some real weapons, not rubbish, arrived to me. Well, you came to the right place, but I’ve lost my instruments long ago. But if you bring me the resources wor a new workshop, I could return to my work, and give the first-class weapons to some of your warriors. For example, your behemoths will be unbeatable in battle, and your enemies shall flee only seeing them! Well, what would you say then?
If you don’t want it, let it be so. But if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Well, that’s a workshop to dream of, my brother would be really envy! Hmm, he is a sort of a blacksmith, too, but of a different kind. He experiments with sea monsters and studies them. Search for him, his service may be of use to you. Well, enough talk – let’s start!
Just say, and I’ll make your behemoths unbeatable!
