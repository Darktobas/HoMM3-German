Name:
The Challenge
Message:
You and your opponent have been itching to fill a void in the hierarchy of Hell's armies.  There is no ruler of the lesser demonic hordes.  You have chosen to fill this role and become King of the Familiars.		To petition the Lords of Hell for such a post, you must have the support of those you wish to control.  They will not take you seriously unless you can prove half a Legion of Imps is at your disposal.  Now 500 Familiars should be easy to gather, no?

Name:
Tribute
Message:
The Gods of Hell demand Tribute.  Payment is mandatory or else torment will be dispensed.
