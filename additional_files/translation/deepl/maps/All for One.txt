Intro part 1

You and your two best friends were inseparable as youths, never doing anything without the others being present.  Later, you entered the King's service, and though you were often assigned to different tasks, the three of you always celebrated together when all was said and done.

When the King died, however, your friendship changed.  Each of you inherited a portion of the kingdom to rule, but when it came down to running the kingdom, each of you had very different opinions on how it should be done.
