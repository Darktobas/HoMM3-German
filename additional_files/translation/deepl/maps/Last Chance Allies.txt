Name:
Intro
Message:
The Royal Executioner arrived today with a message from your King.  The King is angry at the constant raiding between your alliance and your enemies.  He feels that with the constant fighting, you and the other three border lords can't protect your area of the kingdom's border.  The King has decreed his solution.  If there is more than one alliance of Lords in control of this area after two months, he will execute all the remaining Lords and appoint a successor from his court.  His Majesty wishes you and your ally the best of luck in your upcoming campaign.

After hearing your King's message, you invited the Executioner to dine with you.  You assure the King's messenger you fully intend to greet the King as part of the sole alliance of Border Lords in this area in two months.  During dinner, you order your General to call up your forces, and send a message to your ally to raise his troops.  After dessert, you ride out with your troops.

Name:
Blue & Green Intro (Cont)
Message:
Only your advisor warning you of the dire consequences of brash decisions keeps you from slaying the King's Executioner.

Now there are no restraints.

Red & Tan Disguise
Message:
Unexpected news from your outlying guards arrived today.  One of your enemies, disguised as your ally, nearly captured one of your mines a few days ago.  You grimly order all your guards to let no one approach until after then King's deadline.  No one, you emphasize, not even you.

Name:
Blue & Green Disguise
Message:
Your lackeys failed you three days ago.  They bungled capturing one of Tarleton's mines.  You had ordered one to disguise himself as Riston and relieve Tarleton's men with your troops.  However, the fool gave himself away.  Fortunately, he was killed.  No doubt your enemies will try to use your trick against you.  You order all your mine guards to kill anyone who approaches until two months have passed.

Today someone broke into your treasury.  You are actually surprised your enemies would do that.  They are not as dumb as you thought.  They better hope they are not alive when you get your hands on them!

Name:
Blue & Green Month Warning
Message:
One of your more annoying advisers continually reminds you the King's deadline is only one month away.  You have him executed before you while you eat supper.  It makes a pleasant diversion from the stress of command.

Name:
Red & Tan Month Warning
Message:
This morning, during your daily council of war, you reminded your officers the King's deadline was one month away.  You told them you were confident of the war's outcome and promised to reward them for their efforts on your behalf.  They cheered.
