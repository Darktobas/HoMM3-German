Message:
An elf in a strange blue uniform pops out of the bushes just after you wipe guts off  your weapons.  He frowns sternly and says, "You were warned not to litter in Shangri-La.  It takes quite a bit of work to keep this area beautiful.  That will be a  500 gold piece fine."  Sheepishly you pay him.
