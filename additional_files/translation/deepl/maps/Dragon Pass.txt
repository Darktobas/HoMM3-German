Name:
Day 1 event.
Message:
As you start out on your main task (to get into Dragon pass and loot it) it seems that some red dragons have gotten loose into your area and are set about guarding the tent with the orders you need to get into the pass ..sigh.. nothing is ever easy.  You need to find the red dragons and kill them in order to get those orders.

Name:
Dragons in the pass.
Message:
It seems a few traders that have come in from the pass recently report that dragons have started populating it again (go figure).  The resources will not be as simple to get to as they once were.
