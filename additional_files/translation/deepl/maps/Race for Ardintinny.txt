===== Timed events =====

Name:
Revolt!
Message:
The populace controlling Ardintinny has revolted, hanging Lord Thormis. Now in control of the wealth that flows from Medallion Bay they have set themselves up as an independent state. King Magdor has decreed that the lord who can retake the town can have control of Medallion Bay. 

Name:
The Quest
Message:
You and four other lords are fighting to reach Ardintinny first. According to your spies there are large mountain ranges filled with thick forests surrounding Ardintinny.

Name:
Exploration
Message:
Your advisor suggests that you quickly explore your lands. Recent uprisings and troubles have caused mine production to slow. You should send someone out to get the peasants working hard again. Also, there may be places to recruit more armies for your excursion to Ardintinny.

Name:
Infestations
Message:
Reports have come back of infestations of nasty critters in the area! While you were off at the palace these creatures became bold and moved into your area. How rude!

Name:
Scouts
Message:
Quickly, you send out scouts to find out more about these monoliths. It is always good to know if you need a virginal maiden, a calf, or something else in order to gain access to their powers. You must spend some of your resources to fund this little operation.

Name:
To the Sea
Message:
Discovering there is possibility of treasure on the high seas you send out your fleet of ships to explore around your shores. Visions of heavily laden gold ships swim in your head. You immediately order six new ships built.

Name:
Wreckage
Message:
One ship straggles into port, heavily damaged. They faced heavy winds and horrid weather, both of which dashed the fleet onto the reefs. They did report of a strange whirlpool that brought them to Medallion Bay. Unfortunately there is absolutely no place to land.

Name:
Where are they?
Message:
Your scouts have yet to return, and it shouldn't have taken them this long to return from the monoliths. All they had to do was to discover what the monoliths needed to transport troops. Where could they be?

Name:
Any day now...
Message:
Those scouts should show up any day now...

Name:
Good news from the Sea
Message:
One more of your ill-fated ships has returned to port. This one is laden with precious crystal. It was able to navigate the reefs (barely) and return home. It found a small island to the northwest that had an abundance of crystal. They did not stick around to chat with the locals though.

Name:
Still no word
Message:
The resounding silence from your scouts keeps you from resting peacefully at night.

Name:
Homecoming
Message:
One scout has finally made it home. Unfortunately he lost most of his troops, and all of the money you gave him. "We traveled to the other realms, but never once made it to Ardintinny. It was sheer luck that we were able to come home as well." This is not the good news you were hoping for.

Name:
Good News
Message:
Another scout, and you assume the last, has returned from his long time away from home. He made it to Ardintinny! With luck, and that alone, one can get to a center island that leads to Ardintinny. However, you had better be committed to the task for the way is treacherous and hard.
