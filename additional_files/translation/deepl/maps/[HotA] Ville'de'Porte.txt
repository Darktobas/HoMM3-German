One of the Erathian headquarters on the Filato isle had used to be a cash cow for smugglers until the whole army of elementals invaded it. Now chaos reigns there, and no one knows what happens there. Fortunately, Bidley navigated by the isle that time.

Nachricht:
Landing on the shores of Filato disturbs me a lot, I don’t know a thing about what’s happening on this goddamn isle. Why does it seem to me I’m gonna regret about it? Maybe it’s obscurity of everything around that frightens me? Yet still I feel curiosity fills me, I’m tempted to move to this mysterious impassable jungle. Well, since I’m here, I’m to clear up everything happening.

Íà÷àëî 1-2
Nachricht:
My crew decided to stay on the ship, these vultures are afraid of plain trees! Okay, I’m gonna endure without’em, considering some Erathians joined me. They have the same question as me in their minds: what happens on the isle? We’d shed light on it and get out of here, my curiosity may not end up well in time.

Name:
Íà÷àëî 2-1
Nachricht:
It’s a bit strange the Erathians don’t even try to return the town of Seviheart. Can it be that “the Great Erathia” is afraid of a bunch of elementals? However, who knows, maybe there’s much more of’em than I think.

Nachricht:
Long ago there were many Nighonian villages under this isle, so there are small tunnel nets under the ground. Maybe the Erathians would use it to attack Seviheart.

Nachricht:
Just as expected, the Erathians used the old ways of Nighonians and built their headquarters there, thus making a base for themselves to attack. But their assault failed, and now it’s only left to defeat the remnants of their army (yes, the remnants).
