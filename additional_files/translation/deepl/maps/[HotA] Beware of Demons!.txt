This morning, we equipped a small vessel and sent people back to the port from which we got here. I hope they get back home without problems and tell about all of the horrors perpetrated in these parts. They should also ask for reinforcements.

Message:
Stranger! Do you know about the ancient legend of these places? A long time ago the terrible demons of the underworld caught a great ancient hero and put him into an impregnable fortress. As the years passed, ocean waves swept the coastal areas of the island... Since then, the fortress, which has become a tomb for the ancient warrior, was dominated by the water school. Do you see this {blade}? Legend says that a prisoner of the tomb will be able to take it and bring the demons to justice!
Have you seen the tomb that sleeps at the bottom of the sea, stranger?
He's back! Praise the gods!
