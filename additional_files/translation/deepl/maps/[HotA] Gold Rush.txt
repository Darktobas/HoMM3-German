Gold Rush

===== Map description =====
The treasury is empty, and the mines exhausted... In these toilsome times the King sends you to the border of three countries, where on a rocky island, several yet untouched gold mines sit. Capture all four mines before the heroes of other kingdoms do so or the deadline comes, two months from now.

Day 3 
Message:
The situation turned out to be even worse than expected; you will have to make do despite severe shortage of resources, as there are no developed mines in these lands. You'll have to rely on the scouts' cunning and their sticky fingers. Speaking of them, the scouts tell us that in place of the derilict sawmills and quarries, carts full of resources can be found. It would be nice to capture them.
