Intro
Message:
A worthy nobleman was betrothed to a beautiful princess whom he loved deeply.  However, an evil lord who also desired the princess's hand was desperate to prevent the wedding from taking place.  He approached the father with a dreadful (but untrue) prophecy.  If the wedding goes on as planned, the lord told the father, the princess will give birth to a child, but that child will grow up to become a powerful Warlock who will overthrow all the kingdoms in the land.			The Warlock's scheme to have the princess for himself backfired.  The horrified father locked the girl up in his most secure tower, decreeing that she shall forever remain alone and childless.  Despite all pleas and arguments from both the good nobleman and evil lord, the father would not be moved from his decision; so fearful was he of the prophecy.		Now both the nobleman and the lord are determined to rescue the girl from her well-meaning but deceived father.  Unfortunately, the nobleman's quest to regain his princess is doubly difficult, for the evil lord has allied himself with a powerful wizard from a neighboring town.  That wizard has agreed to cast a spell to make the princess fall in love with the evil lord in exchange for her father's kingdom.		Now it is a race to capture the father's town and rescue (or doom) the princess.
