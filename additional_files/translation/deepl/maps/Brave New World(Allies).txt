Day one
Message:
After the Great Upheaval factions have sprung up, but some have learned to work together.  No one Visionary could rule the New World, so the eight Visionaries have chosen their partner and will conquer the world together.  You are one of these powerful Visionaries who will bring about the new age, the Age of Wonder.  Use your vast resources to encourage troops and heroes to follow your banner and unify the other, errant Visionaries under your glorious vision.

Please help us!  We are completely unable to fend off those horrible bloodsucking vampires who always attack our homes.  Right now there is a guardpost to keep them out, but it didn't work!  They just flew right over the flowers!  If you kill them, return with the Vampire's Cowl as proof.  Then you can escort us to our home, and there you will find a big reward!
I'm sorry, but we can't go home until the Vampires are all dead.
Yaaay!  You did it!  Our hero.  Give us the Cowl and we'll join you.  That way you can bring us home.  OK?

Please help us!  We were living peacefully to the south of here in the hills until some Ice Elementals claimed the area!  If you get rid of them we can pay you.  Our savings is quite substantial, about 10,000 gold.  We'll give you all of it just to return home.
Don't lose heart.  Defeating the Ice Elementals is a difficult task, but you will surely succeed.
At last, you defeated the Ice Elementals, and we can go home again!  Are you ready to accept the 10,000 gold?

Hello there.  Come in out of the cold.  Right now I am working on some new formulas, but I need Crystal Dragons.  If I was to obtain say, two of these dragons I would be willing to part with a potion of mine that increases your Attack by ten.  But only if you bring me two Crystal Dragons.
No luck in finding the 2 Crystal Dragons?  I'm sure you'll find some to the west of here.  
At last, 2 Crystal Dragons.  If you would be so kind as to chain them outside I will give you the potion.  You are still willing to trade aren't you?

Only those who are well rounded enough can come in and kiss the Blattner Stone.  Once you have reached 10 in each of your primary skills you may come in and raise the morale of your men by three.
You're not worthy.

We're trying to build a new place on one of those cozy islands off the coast.   If you could bring me 10 Wood, 5 Mercury, 10 Ore, 5 Sulfur, 5 Crystal, 5 Gems and 3000 Gold, we could get the construction underway.  If you do so I'll teach you some tricks I bet you didn't learn in school!
Oh my, that's simply not enough.  I need 10 Wood, 5 Mercury, 10 Ore, 5 Sulfur, 5 Crystal, 5 Gems and 3000 Gold.  I'll never complete it with what you have.
Finally!  Here, give me the resources and I'll teach you what they don't know in schools.  You'll learn a lot and it'll help you rise through the ranks quicker.  Still willing to fess up the resources?

I am sorry, but this glen belongs to the Sprites.  Only when all 75 of them have found transportation here shall we move from our post.
I am sorry, you have not returned with all of them.
Now you may enter their territory as they have come home.  If you will be so kind as to release them to us so we can be on our way.  You will do this won't you?

We are a horde of Magma Elementals who are looking for someone to follow.  Only a hero of great renown and at least rank ten will be able to lead us.  Come back when you are worthy of our loyalty.
Faugh.  You again.  Come back when you are level 10, for you are not worthy.
Finally!  Someone who is worthy to lead us.  Will you take us with you?
