The guards here will let no one pass unless they have enough gold to buy the castle.  They will let you pass for 50637 gold pieces.
Since you have not brought 50605 Gold, the guards forbid your passage.
Congratulations!  This exquisite castle is yours if you pay the price of 50605 gold.  Do you wish to buy it?

Message:
The contents of the box are very dangerous.  The guards eye you dubiously but agree to let you by when you have reached level 9 experience.
The guards here simply will not permit anyone below level 9 to pass.
The guards acknowledge that you have indeed reached level 9.  Do you wish to go to the box at this time?
