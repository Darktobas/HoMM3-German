===== Timed events =====

Name:
Zeus
Message:
Once again you must prove you are better than all of the other Gods, for you are Zeus.  This time things are a bit more serious as you must find out what has happened in Hades.  All of your dalliances are to be put aside, well most anyway.  One or two can't hurt - No! you must focus or else all will be lost.  Hercules and Persues were successful as your Heroes and are more than willing to help out again.  This is, afterall a very worthy cause and quite within their realm of expertise.  Now you must find out what is going on around here.

Name:
Ares
Message:
Once again duty has called for the God of War to come to save the day.  You are quite used to such things as the other Gods wouldn't know how to run an assault to save their lives.  These disturbances in Hades don't normally concern you, but it seems the undead are getting a little a little out of hand.  No matter, you will prevail.  Paris, the man who started the Trojan war and Enyo, the Greek Goddess of War, have joined up with your cause, wanting to support you in this hour of glory.

Name:
Apollo
Message:
Once again the Sun God has taken to Greece in order to save the day.  Not that you, Apollo, mind so much, but it is sort of mundane to not be driving your chariot across the sky each day.  The boys are pretty well trained and should do well without your guidance for some time.  These happenings in Hades have nothing to do with your realm, but it seems very important to Zeus, and Demeter can be such a pain when she wants to.  Since her daughter, Perspone, is down there everyone has to help out or she'll get uppity.  You've recruited Abaris and Laocoon to act as your scouts and guides.

Name:
Athena
Message:
It seems Greece is once again in need of your great wisdom and intellect, but then again who does not need the Goddess of Wisdom on their side?  As Zeus's favored daughter you are practically necessary to the entire ordeal.  Last time did teach you a valuable lesson though.  Artemis is far too much trouble to have around on the Greek lands.  The woman really needs to quit bathing in public and then killing those poor Peeping Toms.  This time you have recruited Theseus and Erechtheus.  Much better choices, excellent heroes who will accomplish this task quickly.

Name:
Aphrodite
Message:
Once again you will have the opportunity to tortue the mortal men with your astounding beauty and charm.  As the Goddess of Beauty you aren't all that concerned with what happens in Hades, but who knows?  It could just be fun.  If it's not, then you can easily leave.  You will easily find out what the trouble is and take all of the credit.  This sort of thing goes over well with followers.  Eros, your son and Aeneas a handsome man you have admired for some time now, will aid your quest by being your heroes.

Name:
Hades Takes a Vacation
Message:
For the past two months Hades has been on vacation.  Up until now things have been quiet and there hasn't been any troubles what so ever.  However, the Oracles at Delphi warned of a great problem, and it would be best for the gods to prepare for a disaster.  Henceforth, the five of you are here, preparing your heroes for what is to come.  Whatever that may be.  Some have been rather miffed because Hades hasn't even sent a note as to how his vacation is going.  Demeter is really upset because he didn't take Perspone, and is thinking he's dishonouring his wife.

Name:
Time of Year
Message:
In the northern areas of Greece winter has fallen, covering the lands in a thick blanket of snow.  Throughout the middle parts of Greece Autumn is slowly gaining it's grip on the land, but summer has still kept hold in the southern parts.  You know Demeter, the Goddess of Earth is upset because her daughter has to stay with Hades for six months of the year.  Wanting her precious daughter to herself, Demeter cannot have what she wants and takes her frustrations out on the citizens of Greece.  Soon the entire country will be engulfed in snow.  Then Perspone will return to lands above the Underworld and to her loving mother's care.  Once this occurs, Spring will return and all will be happy.  For this day all of Greece waits and the land goes into a frozen sleep.

Name:
Pandora Releases Evil
Message:
A young woman named Pandora is the great granddaughter of the original Pandora, who released the evil spirits into the world.  Now, it appears this one has released evil demons into the world.  They fled through the night, wreaking havoc and attacking the townsfolk.  Heroes and militia were able to drive the beasts away, but they were released into the world none the less.  Pandora, fearing retribution is nowhere to be found.  Apparently she fears the gods will punish her for releasing these horrors.

Name:
Pandora's Box
Message:
Pandora did not just leave the box where she found it, but took it with her.  After some tracking they know she left mainland Greece, but do not know where.  Rumor has it she left the box somewhere secluded in order to ensure no one will open it again.  You must find the box because as everyone knows the means to defeating these horrid creatures are within Pandora's Box.  More people are sent out in order to search for the Box, and all pray to the Gods the box is found soon.

Name:
Punishment - Athena

Since Artemis was under your guidance when you last dabbled in the mortal world you are responsible for her actions.

Name:
Punishment - Aphrodite
Message:
Your little scheme to get back at Zeus and Hera did not go unnoticed.  A poor, innocent young woman died because of your treachery and now you shall be punished.  Nemesis has you create a shrine in honor of the young woman, who's only crime was to fall in love. 

Name:
Power 2
Message:
All this week you have felt tired at some point in the day.  Not the tired that comes with dealing with mortals, but the kind from using too much power.  For a God this is an impossible thing.  Immediately you send some wise men to investigate and come up with a solution.

Name:
Oracle
Message:
Word has been confirmed, the Oracle of Delphi knows where Pandora is.  However, the Oracle will only speak to the Heroes of a God.  In order to find out where the box is, or where Pandora is you must go to the Oracle located at Delphi.

Name:
Power -3 
Message:
The wise men have conferred.  These Devils and Demons have found a way to drain the power from the Gods.  If they are not destroyed in ten months you will become nothing more than a mortal.  According to the Scholar's calculations you have already wasted over forty days!  Horrified you contact the others, who also report the same troubles.  They must be stopped.

Name:
Marpessa
Message:
A marvelous woman with long brown hair and beautiful eyes of placid water has drawn your thoughts each day for some time now.  Unable to stand it any longer you go to her home with intentions of wooing her.  Successfully you do so, for she is enamored with your wit, charm, and beautiful poems you can devise and beautifully sing.

Name:
Wisdom
Message:
As the grey-eyed Goddess of Wisdom you are often called the mind of the gods.  You are able to bestow skill and courage, victory in war for the just or destruction for the unjust at a whim.  		Today is a day of trials, when cases which are so difficult no other can sort them out, you are the one who does so.  After five cases you had the opportunity to punish three who were unjust and reward two who were very just.

Marpessa

Returning to her cabin you find her gone, only a note saying she has left with Idas in a winged chariot.  Enraged you pursue the couple, hunting them across Greece.  Finding them, you are prepared to destroy Idas and take Marpessa for your own.  Posiedon, the one who gave Idas the winged chariot intervenes and says Zeus should decide the matter.  Taking the issue to Zeus he agrees to decide the case.  You explain your undying love and infatuation for Marpessa very eloquently.  She steps forward with fear in her voice, and whispers her concerns.  Marpessa fears you will leave her in her old age, when she is no longer a vision of perfection.  Zeus agrees with her wise decision and rules Marpessa will be wife to Idas.  Brokenhearted you storm from the place.

Name:
Discovery
Message:
Again you have traveled to Haphaestus's smithy in order to be with your lover.  Lying on the bed, entwined in each other's arms you are suddenly bound by metal strips, tightly holding you to the bed.  To your shock and horror the other gods appear and begin to laugh at the two of you caught in the bed, naked and exposed.  Glaring you realize it was Helius, the Sun-God who sees everything, who told Haphaestus about your midnight excursions in his forge.  Burning with rage you break free and run from the smithy.

Name:
Discovery
Message:
Haphaestus calls all of the gods to his forge, but tells you not to mention a word to Aphrodite or Ares.  Wondering what could possibly be going on you quietly wait with the others in a dark corner of the smithy.  Eventually Ares arrives, and then Aphrodite.  Together they undress and climb into the small cot just behind the forge.  Trying to stifle a giggle at their pillow talk you suddenly howl with laughter as the two are surprised with metal arms springing from the bed and clamping them tightly in.  Laughing and pointing at their naked bodies you laugh until your sides hurt, and tears wobble out of your eyes.  With rage, the couple flees from the smithy, but you still roll on the floor laughing.

Name:
Prometheus
Message:
With great rage you tear after Prometheus, the fool who gave man fire.  Nailing his sorry carcass to Mount Caucasus you send an eagle to him every day.  There the eagle can swoop down and devour the exposed liver of Prometheus.  Each night the liver will grow again so he can undergo this vicious tortue the next day.  Satisfied he has been punished enough you sleep well tonight.

Name:
Power 4
Message:
Today, it was hard going just to grant a few simple requests.  You were supposed to help out your loyal followers, but only cryptic messages got through.  This whole draining of your godly power is rediculous!  It must be stopped soon.

Name:
Nightmare
Message:
With the weakening of your power nightmares are creeping into your uneasy sleep.  Terrifying images of being too weak to snap vines or ropes cause cold sweats to soak your bed.  The most vivid nightmare is when the Aloads bound you for just over a year.  The bonds held you inside a small, enclosed brazen jar on which you could not escape.  For so long those little walls were your whole life and dark terror played tricks and games with your mind.  Just as you were to collapse Hermes rescued you.  To this day you wake with a scream in your throat if you so much as think about what would happen if he didn't.

Name:
Olive Branch
Message:
For some time now you have realized the peasantry was missing out on some very important skills.  Taking the olive tree from a rock you bring it to farmers and show them how to plant and grow olive trees.  From there you show them how to make olive oil and learn to cook with it.  This is part of your daily life because you are the Goddess of Wisdom, and the one with all of the knowledge the people need.

Name:
Affair with Hermes
Message:
Hermes, the handsome messenger of the gods has been attracted to you for some time now.  Ares, now unwilling to even speak to you, is out of your horizon for a long time.  Doesn't matter, Hermes is much better looking and a lot less pushy than the God of War.  After a few glasses of wine, and some small chit chat you discover exactly what Hermes can deliver.  Enjoying your evening thoroughly, you invite him to deliver a message to you again.

Name:
Cyparissus
Message:
One of your more loyal followers, Cyparissus, has been praying to you because he can find no consolation.  One of his prized stags was killed, and he is asking permission to grieve forever.  Granting him the wish you turn him into a Cypress tree deciding his place would always be where others could grieve.

Name:
Affair with Hermes
Message:
Hermes was obviously unable to wait very long before delivering a message, sening your head into the clouds and your heart on cloud nine.  After coming down you realize this coupling will produce a wonderful bundle of joy.  Telling Hermes about this, he seems a little chillier than before.  Reassuring him he will be able to visit the child at any time, but wasn't expected to be around.  After all, message delivery is a busy business, and things have been sort of crazy lately.

Name:
Report
Message:
The reports from the Underworld have come in.  Things are not well there.  Perspone has been captured and Demeter has flown off the handle and gone to rescue her daughter.  The Demons and Devils are everywhere, guarding their new realm.  Tartarus has been turned into a play ground for the wicked. Someone must go restore order.  The dead are not being processed and are begining to pile up here and there, even in some places above ground.  No one knows what happened to Hades' assistants, but all must be released to continue with their jobs. 

Name:
Clothing
Message:
It has been a while since you helped the people invent better clothing.  Haphaestus has helped with armor and such, as he is the Smith-God, but he doesn't concern himself with clothing so much.  So you introduce embroidery and other fineries related to clothing.  Styles will soon change in Greece, and clothing will become more complex - and hopefully a little more covering.

Name:
Hephaestus
Message:
Hephaestus has been nothing but trouble, and you will have to cast him out of the heavens.  Hera and you were having one of your fights and the little twerp tried to interfere on her behalf!  Then again, when you were arguing with Athena, he tried to help her!  So now, he gets the boot and you don't have to worry about some stupid, meddling smith god every time you want to have a good row.

Name:
Hermaphroditus

Now that the peasantry has Pottery down, and it's incorporated into their lifestyle, you decide they should learn how to create glass and use it in their homes.  After many burned fingers and hot hours you teach a few how to blow glass.  All of the nobles want glass in their homes to keep the bugs out, and you are getting much praise these days.

Name:
Hyacinthus
Message:
A young man so sweet and pure of heart has turned your head.  He is a wonderful youth with great potential.  Interested in encouraging Hyacinthus you go to meet him.  But, because of this power fluctuation you arrive and much to your horror kill him accidently.  His blood stains the ground, and a flower springs forth which you name after your lost love, Hyacinthus.

Name:
Ganymedes
Message:
It seems Aphrodite and some of the other female goddesses have taken up with this Ganymedes, a handsome youth who is the son of King Laomedon of Troy.  Sighing, you decide the youth will have to be the cupbearer of the gods, just to keep the hands of the ladies off him.  In compensation to his father for the deflowering of his son, you have to give the King some fine mares.  The ladies will definitely hear about this.

Name:
Anchises
Message:
A handsome mortal man has caught your eye, Anchises.  Enchanted by your wit and charm Anchises is quickly caught up in your splendor.

Using your invention keeps the little ones at bay, and you are pleased with yourself as you leave him in the morning.

Name:
Power 5
Message:
Things are slowly getting worse.  You've come to the conclusion if things are not stopped soon you'll fade away into nothingness.  Gods after all, are made up only of their power.  Without it, you will cease to exist.

Name:
Anniversary of Trial
Message:
This is the day when you try to remember what could have happened if you were not aquitted.  This is the day when you are calm, when nothing is allowed to disturb your contemplation.  Many years ago one of Posiedon's sons, Halirrhothius attemtped to violate your precious daughter Alcippe.  You were able to stop the beastly brat, but only by killing him.  Angry Posiedon called for a trial, and you were tried before the twelve other gods.  Fear had gripped your spine that day, for if you had been convicted all of your power would be stripped.  The Areogapus Hill, which is now called the Hill of Ares, still has the power to set your skin crawling.  You will never forget what it was like to gain vengence, but will also know it can only be done on the battlefield where it is acceptable.

Name:
Murder of Clytaemnestra
Message:
Orestes, is a young man who recently killed his mother Clytaemnestra.  With no one to stand over the trial because none have ever been held before, you are the obvious choice to be the first to oversee this case.  It was complicated because Clytaemnestra had killed her husband, Agamemnon.  You determine that Orestes should be aquitted because he was avenging the murder of his father.

Name:
Bacchanalia
Message:
This is the celebration of Wine and Song, Bacchanalia in honor of Bacchus who brings such wonderful beverages.  Singing contests, ballads, poetry, and plenty of drink go around today.  Many people spend the day eating and enjoying wine-tasting contests.  That evening you relax with your troops, drinking as much wine as you can consume and singing until your throat is sore.  No one cares if anyone can sing well or off-key.  It's a night for parties and friends, a good night to be alive and well.

Name:
Ow.
Message:
You're paying for last night.  When will you ever learn that wine gives you a headache?  People are in a good mood, despite the abundance of hangovers.  At least you were smart enough to drink lots of water and avoid the worst of it.  Can't wait until next year, but Hermes won't be drinking and flying ever again.

Name:
Power 6
Message:
With each passing day you worry more and more about your waning powers.  The men are beginning to note a slight difference in you.  The simple act of keeping yourself smellling clean and fresh has become a luxury you cannot afford.  You actually had to take a bath today.  What a fiasco!

Name:
War Wound
Message:
Earlier in the morning it had been raining, and caused your thigh to ache.  Not knowing what this could be you confidentially asked an aid.  There is no reason for such pain, and you have never experienced this before.  He asked you if you have ever been wounded there.  Yes, Hercules had scored on you when you were helping the Pylians with their war.  The little fart was able to take a good chunk out of your thigh.  The aid explains why weather affects old wounds.  You realize it's better to be a god than to be mortal.

Name:
Callirrhoe
Message:
Callirrhoe has always been a loyal follower.  Now she asks a favor of you, that her sons will be fully grown in order to avenge their father's murder.  Thinking on the request, knowing it is cruel to deprive a child of their childhood, but still even more cruel to have them grow up without a father, you agree.  With a wave of your hand the boys are fully grown, have weapons and armor, and directions to their father's murderer.

Name:
Phaethon
Message:
For two days you have enjoyed the tender touches of the youthful Phaethon.  It has been a joyful and wonderful time for you both, but now must end.  The duties of being a god are beginning to hedge in on your little vacation.  Regretfully you send Phaethon back to his woodland home.

Name:
Hephaestus
Message:
Hephaestus pays you a visit after tasting some of Dionysus's wines.  Knowing he is drunk and in an amorous mood you try to politely fend off his advances.  Eventually you are forced to clock him as a few drops of liquid fall upon your leg.  Disgusted you flick the semen off your leg and kick the unconscious God.  He does nothing more than belch and roll over.  Rolling your eyes you are glad your virginity is still intact and leave the building.

Name:
Hymenaeus
Message:
Watching the mortals has caused your eye to stray towards a handsome young man by the name of Hymenaeus.  While spending much time with him you forget to keep an eye on things back at the castle.  Hermes, the eternal trickster is able to steal some of your cattle, sending the herders into a tizzy.  Enraged you are able to get them back, but you do lose time spent with Hymenaeus.

Name:
Power 7
Message:
In order to keep underlings and opponents in check you often use a simple power to augment your glory and power.  This time it didn't work quite so well and you ended up looking more like a blowhard than a powerful god.  This is not good at all.

Name:
Erichthonius
Message:
It seems the encounter with the Smith god, Hephaestus produced an offspring.  Apparently the boy has the lower body of a snake and the upper body of a human.  His name is Erichthonius.  Taking pity on the poor boy you change the lower half of his body into that of human form and send him off to Athens where he can be educated by your priests.

Name:
Adonis
Message:
A young man with unparalleled ability in sculpting has often produced works which have entranced you.  Enjoying your quiet visits to his studio you are always interested to see what he is working on next.  This time he has made a woman of pure white stone, a breathtaking beauty.  Bitterly he throws his chisel on the ground and weeps at the feet of the statue.  Heartbroken to see your favorite sculptor like this you listen closely to his heart to find the root of the problem.  You need not listen too hard.  He is weeping because he has fallen in love with the statue.  She is created in the perfect image of his ideal lover, and has given her all of the traits he would want, reflecting them in her statue.  With great pity you breathe life into the statue, exactly as he has hoped.  Filled with joyful wonder Adonis takes the woman in his arms and praises you, knowing only Aphrodite would do something like this for love.

Name:
Alcinoe

A poor woman who is a spinner named Nicandra beseeches you at your temple in Athens.  She worked a full year for Alcinoe, but did not recieve all of her pay.

Name:
Juturna
Message:
A beautiful maiden who visits an exquisite lake everyday has turned your head.  Ensuring Hera is busy elsewhere you go and ravish the woman.  Afterwards you hold her in your arms, whispering sweet nothings in her ear.  Realizing she is shuddering with sobs you ask her what is wrong.  Apparently she was a follower of Artemis, and the Virgin Goddess will be displeased with her.  Knowing Artemis will most likely punish her, you decide it would be better to make her a goddess.  Therefore, she becomes the Goddess of Lakes and Rivers, with eyes like placid pools - which you will often get lost in.

Name:
Battle
Message:
A recent battle, close to one of your castles took place while you were away.   The first thing you ask is if Deimos and Phobus were there.  The general nods his head yes.  The sons of Ares, Fear and Terror were there to whip the enemy into small pieces.  You grin proudly, for your warrior sons are the pride of your offspring.

Name:
Alcinoe
Message:
Your vengence on Alcinoe has come to fruitition.  She has fallen in love with a rogue who will take her far away and dump her when he's done.  In the meantime Alcinoe's husband needs to have a wife to raise his three children.  Just as luck would have it Nicandra knows the children well and they get along.  So Nicandra has a home and Alcinoe will be on the street soon.  All is right with the world.

Message:
Time to Paaarty!  In celebration of Spring everyone cuts loose.  Even Hera lets her hair down.  Everyone drinks deeply and eats well.  Peasants and craftsmen make merry all day long.  You enjoy the parties and contests, just living it up well into the night.  Even if the snow has yet to lift, it will surely do so soon.

Name:
Hangover
Message:
Well, you're paying for last night's parties.  Your head feels like it's going to explode and the last thing you remember was praying to stop turning your stomach inside out.  The cat walks far too heavily and you swear the dead are making the loudest racket you've ever heard.

Name:
Power - 8
Message:
It has become apparent you are slowly losing your powers.  The simple things are no longer simple, and it gets harder to keep up the more complicated things.  Soon your powers will fade away all together.  Either destroy the demons or face oblivion.

Name:
Prince of Thieves
Message:
Autolycus, the Prince of Thieves was seen outside of your court the other day.  His giddy laughter was heard in the Marketplace as he tossed a coin into the air.  Fearing the worst your Treasurer counts the Kingdom's resources and comes up a bit short.  Screaming mad you want that Thief's head, but none can find him.  Some day rather soon you will find the weaselly little schmuck and tear him limb from limb.

Name:
Power - 9
Message:
The drain on your power has become more and more obvious.  The weaker you get the less likely you will be able to fend off the mortals.  Soon it will be almost all up to the demi-gods who do not rely on such power to complete this mission.  

Name:
Strikes Again!
Message:
The Prince of Thieves has struck again - or at least someone looking a lot like the sneaky thief.  Now he has definitely gone one step too far, but no one can get their hands on him.  Zeus is going to set up a trap for him, hopefully it'll work.

Name:
Trap fails
Message:
Zeus attempts to catch the thief, but he laughs in the God's face and skips away merrily.  Along with him he takes some resources.  For several days you kick the kitchen dogs in outrage.

Name:
Power - 10
Message:
You have grown so weak, it is easier to choose a human form and stay in it, rather than conduct the search for the demons in your god form.  Relying on messengers and the magicks of mortals to keep up the lesser communications is beginning to grind on you.  But until order can be restored all you can do is kick the dog.

Name:
Finally!
Message:
This time you know the trap will work.  Each of you are working hard to catch Autolycus and stop him from taking all of your resources.  You need those to save the world.  Well, he sneaks in past everyone, but the second he touches the tempting diamond, BAM!  He's caught like the rat he is.  

Name:
Caught!
Message:
Autolycus is dumped upside down and shaken for all he's worth.  Once everything is sorted out and split up there isn't much.  Seems he had a great few weeks on you.  Smacking him around a bit, and tossing him into jail, Autolycus decides rather quickly he will stop robbing from the gods and stick to the mortals.

Name:
Butes
Message:
A handsome youth, with a strong body and a love for travel has caught your eye.  He is Butes, and traveled with Jason and the Argonauts for some time.  You watch over him, ensuring no harm comes to him for if you get the time he will know you in a very personal way.

Name:
Butes
Message:
Butes swam off to be with the Sirens, enchanted by their vile song.  With a quick hand you fish him out of the sea and place him in Sicily.  There he will be safe from the Sirens, and from the demons who are running amuck these days.  Feeling as if you need a good night you tell Butes who rescued him, and exactly how he can repay you.  He is a willing partner in the night's activities.

Name:
Diomedes
Message:
Your son, Diomedes is the King of Bistonians in Thrace.  Soon his birthday will be coming up and you have to think of a suitable present.  Otherwise his mother, Cyrene will once again give the better gift.  She left you a few years ago.   Of course, it's all due to Apollo who found her wrestling a lion without any weapons and fell in love with her.  He's always falling in love - with other people's women that is.  Rage burns in your heart and you need to consider the issue longer.

Name:
Rhoeo

A beautiful young woman by the name of Rhoeo has caught your attention, and you pay her a visit.  After spending the night in exquisite pleasure you take your leave, waking no one in the household.

Name:

In order to entice you into meeting him he has been just, kind and has learned all he can.  Also he has tried to be humble and caring to all those around him.  Finally swayed by his actions you agree to meet with him.  Upon meeting him you realize how much you enjoy his company and wish to continue to see him.  That evening, as you hold him close you know both of you will be extremely happy for a long time.

Name:
Diomedes
Message:
Ha!  You have arrived upon the perfect gift.  Diomedes loves horses, but he also thinks that everything should be a carnivore.  So you will give him some flesh-eating horses.  That'll keep the peasantry in line as well, and definitely show up Cyrene.

Name:
Aegina
Message:
A daughter of the river god Asopus, Aegina is a most beautiful woman.  Carrying her away in the guise of an eagle to the island Oenone you have your way with the beautiful woman.  You promise the island will be named after her, Aegina.  While you are spending some time with the beauty her father pursues you.  Using your lightning bolts you are able to send him away to his own streams and leave the two of you alone.

Name:
Rhoeo
Message:
Able to return to your beloved Rhoeo you find she is not in her room.  Wondering what happened to her you begin to question the servants.  Her father became aware of Rhoeo's indiscretion and believed it was a common man who put her in the motherly way.  Angry, he has shut her up in a chest and cast her into the sea.  Terrified she would die you immediately get a hold of Posiedon.

Name:
Power - 11
Message:
You stink.  This whole being mortal thing all of the time is a difficult and obnoxious situation.  Bathing?  What in Hades is that?  Well, one of your Generals politely informs you how to bathe, comb your hair, brush your teeth and a lot of other embarassing details that should never be mentioned again.  This whole thing is getting old pretty darn quick.  Time to destroy the demons and get back to normal!

Name:
Rhoeo
Message:
Posiedon was able to find the chest and float it to the shores of Delos where she would be safe.  You arrange for her to have a mortal husband and whisper in her ear to name your son Anius and help him become one of your priests.

Name:
Diomedes
Message:
Diomedes loved your present much better than his mother's gifts.  She got him a couple of girls who dance well, and probably sing or something, but nothing could compare to those perfect flesh-eating horses.  Cyrene had said it was something only you and Diomedes could appreciate, no one else could.  Good, you think.  Afterall who else matters?

Name:
Helius
Message:
Now you have had time to spend with him and know him much better, in many ways, you decide he must be kept safe.  Placing Helius on a island with only his close friends and a few servants you ensure his safety.  Taking your leave you intend to return once all of the troubles with the demons is done.

Name:
Lemnian Women
Message:
With all of the power drains it is imperative that each god is worshipped to maximum capacity, especially now.  You have discovered that no woman of Lemnian has honored you in some time.  With great rage you arrive there to forcefully explain the situation.  Believing the Goddess of Love to be irrelevant they scorn you and turn their backs.  With great anger you remove the love between them and their husbands, causing the husbands to consort with Thracian women who are in need of good men.  After this the men leave the Lemnian women, leaving the island inhabited solely by bitter women.

Name:
Cycnus
Message:
Cycnus is one of your daughters.  She is a bit uppity, but she is the daughter of a god after all.  One of her suitors, a handsome youth by the name of Phylius is constantly trying to win her heart.  Unfortunately she keeps having him do all sorts of tasks or bring her gifts.  You bring her to the castle to talk sense into her.  Of course she does not listen to her father.  Do children ever?

Name:
Britomartis
Message:
Your daughter by Carme, Britomartis was pursued by King Minos of Create.  She leapt from the cliffs, and you feared she was dead.  Luckily, some fishermen caught her up in their nets and cared for her.  Artemis, hearing of the maidens lengths to keep her maiden hood intact, has made Britomartis a Goddess of the Moon.  Well, it is better than a dead or ravished daughter, but another Goddess of the Moon?

Name:
Cycnus
Message:
Cycnus has gone too far this time.  The poor young man will not complete one of the tasks.  Desperate and out of hope he throws himself from a cliff.  Feeling pity for the poor young man you turn him into a swan so he may lead a more placid and fulfilling life than running after your foolish daughter.

Name:
Corybantes
Message:
It has become apparent you are going to have Helius's child.  Knowing it will not do to be in a motherly way now, you speed things up and bring the boy, named Corybantes to the island with his father.  Now you can see both of them at once when it is convient for you.

Name:
Lemnian Women
Message:
After a few days of no men the women begin to see things your way.  They worship heavily, fasting and making several offerings.  Finally appeased you send them new men, but remind the Lemnian women to never scorn any god.

Name:
Meleager
Message:
One of your sons, Meleager was one of the Argonauts, a great fighter and warrior.  Proud of one son who could fight well and was considered honorable you always ensured the chest with the brand in it was kept safe.  Of course it had been Althaea's idea to keep the brand from burning out so Meleager could live a long and full life.  If it burned out he would die, or at least according to the Moerae - who are rarely wrong.		But today your pride has ended for him.  Meleager has killed all of his mother's brothers.  Each were good men with families, and Althaea has cried bitterly all day.  Now she has pulled the brand from the chest and lit it.  Knowing this is the only way for her to ensure Meleager does nothing so cruel again, you let her end your son's life.

Name:
Cycnus
Message:
Heartbroken, your daughter Cycnus comes to you.  She has finally realized her love for Phylius and feels guilty about the whole thing, and wants to be with him.  Sighing heavily you decide to help her out, but not the way she thinks.  Quietly you turn her into a swan so she and Phylius can live peacefully together forever.

Name:
Power - 12
Message:
Your limits of patience have been maxed out and pushed beyond belief.  Being mortal rots, and all you want to do is go back to Mt. Olympus.  Unfortunately, with all of the power drained from it, Mt. Olympus is nothing more than a big hunk of rock.  Darn it!  Patience at an end you throw a fit worthy of a bedraggled God and plan the last stages of your assault on the demons.

A group of strange men are sitting in a glen, chatting about the philosophies which is better, beer or wine.  Heatedly discussing such fine points as, wine and beer help you have fun, according to Ryionius and Waltus.   Davius and Mikeus were discussing that if they drank at all it would have to be wine because it would be better to follow Dionysus.  Marcus, who was named after Mars, the Roman God of War was arguing that wine and beer simply addle the senses and make you unable to fight well.   After listening to them ramble on for a while, another joins the fray, Gustus chimed in from just outside the glen that wine is definitely better, along with Bonitius who agrees.  Laughing gaily at their lighthearted converstaion you introduce yourself. 		After all of the jaws are picked up off the ground they begin to ask you questions:  Are good are you in bed?  (which was responded with "How Wude" from Gustus)  My house or yours?  and of course the classic: " What is your sign?"

A group of young men sit around trying to play instruments while another attempts to warble acceptably.  Others, who are their friends, clap their hands over their ears and pray someone will silence the young group who calls themselves the "Honkeys".  Davius comments they are called that because of the horrid sounds the group makes.  Waltus says they can't even be considered a musical group, but could be considered a weapon of war.  As the insults continue you decide to do something to help this poor band.		Arriving on the scene all are relieved.  The listeners are happy - thinking you will at least push the mute button on these guys.  The 'musicians' are happy, thinking you have come to congratulate their work.  Both sets are disappointed at first.		"I will not stop you, but will help you get a little better."  You say and wave your hand, causing the group to understand the concepts of harmony, rythym and beat.  Afterwards everyone is much happier.

Message:
A group of young men, known only as the "Designers" are standing around, showing off hand-to-hand combat moves, albeit badly.  Laughing and playing around at beating each other up you decide to show them how it is really done.		Upon your arrival they instantly recognize you as you introduce yourself.  The responses are as follows:  Mikeus: "Peace Bro".  Ryan, "Hi" he squeaks and pees himself.  Marcus, "Prove it" Davius, "Fight any good wars lately?"  Timieas, "Want a Honkeys sticker?"  Waltus - passed out.		Things went downhill from here.

Message:
A discussion of "Why" has come up.  Of course the various answers are, "Why is Ryionus stupid?"  "Because he was born that way, or he worked really hard at it."  More questions of Why? came about, but all went on in a rediculous endless cycle of why.  Amused by the amateur philosophies passing about you decide to pay them a visit.		Introducing yourself they immediately begin to barrage you with inane questions.  Jeffius, "What was it like coming out of that dude's brain?"  Ryionus, "How much wood can a woodchuck chuck?"  Marcus, "Why do hotdogs come in packages of 10 and buns in packages of 8?"  Waltius, "How big-?" Ryionus interrupts - "is the world in centimeters?"  Davius, "Where ever you go, there you are."  Mikeus, "Is it OK for Vegetarians to eat Animal Crackers?"		You decide they really don't want to have any of your wisdom, frown,  and turn them into toads.

Message:
Coming around the mountain you come across a group of men called the Designers.  They are sitting around chatting when you walk into the middle of the glen.		Ryionus, instantly recognizing you says, "Hey!  Do lightning bolts really come out of your arse?"  You respond with, "I'm Zeus, not William Wallace!"  And turn him into a million atoms.  Davius says, "Finally!"  Waltius Chimes in, "Cool!  Can you do it again?"  You think about it and turn him into a million atoms.  Mikeus drops to his knees and begins to bow saying, "I'm not worthy!  I'm not worthy!"  Marcus begins to dance a jig.		Realizing these guys are lunatics you make a hasty exit, stage left.
