===== Map description =====
Sir Mullich's act got old. The morning after the infamous knight had another violent ourburst, he woke up to an empty castle. His people packed up and left in the thick of the night, just as Mullich was given a pest control mission in the royal countryhouse...

Message:
Mullich was even madder than usual. The fleeing soldiers took everything they could carry. There was no one left in the castle. Valets, stableboys, blacksmiths, the century-old housekeeper, just about everyone legged it. The only one to stay was David the squire, whom Mullich ordered to tie to a pole the day before after the guy stole a ham from the master pantry. The kid was in for a rotten string of days, as Mullich would definitely be taking it all out on him.

Admittance will set you back 10 crystals, no less.
You don't have 10 crystals to spare? For shame! And you dare call yourself a knight!
Hand over the crystals, and begone. I myself am getting tired of slacking here.

I believe I've found a way to bless men who don't have innate magical abilities. I want to carry out and experiment, but I'm afraid I'm lacking a suitable subject. Do you happen to have an elf to spare? I won't break him, I promise!
An elf! I need an elf!
I hope your elf doesn't mind partaking in my experiment. Thing is... it has a rather unusual side-effect.

Oh, bless you! My collection is complete now! Would you like to pass?
