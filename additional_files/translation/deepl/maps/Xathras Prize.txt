Name:
Intro part 1
Message:
Ahhh, there's nothing like a nice, cash reward to get the blood racing. Until today, you were never even sure the City of Xathras existed, but you have the letter in your hands, signed by Xian, Overlord of Xathras, offering a reward of ONE MILLION gold to whoever brings the Grail to his city.

Name:
Intro part 2
Message:
As you sit down to breakfast, an advisor approaches with news. Apparently the letter you received was also sent to each of the other kingdoms in the land, offering the same reward, and the other leaders are quite likely mobilizing their forces at this very moment. Others will be searching as well!

Name:
Warning.
Message:
Rumor has it that the leaders of Xathras will try to kill any heroes that come around, in hopes of finding the Grail first, thereby avoiding having to pay the reward!
