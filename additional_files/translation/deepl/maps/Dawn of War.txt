Message:
As you are walking through the forest you come across a half buried skeleton.  Thinking to yourself that this is an improper burial you decide to dig up the skeleton  and give it a proper burial.   It took about 3 hours to dig the hole and place the skeleton inside.  As you throw dirt inside the hole you notice a glint as the sun hits something metal inside the pile of dirt.  Reaching for it, you find a magnificent sword.
