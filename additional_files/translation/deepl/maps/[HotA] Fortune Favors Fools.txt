===== Map description =====
You've always been a bit thick. For a firstborn son, that's unfortunate. Unable to accept his heir being a good-for-nothing dimwit, your father negotiated an appointment for you. This nice domain is yours to rule; the only task is "don't screw up". It doesn't sound hard, but you've got history.

Name:
hum bonus
Message:
You have no idea where all this stuff and men have come from. The keep's majordomo, a wrinkly old mage, is doing his best to not look you in the eye.

Timed events:

Name:
hum bonus
Message:
Your soldiers claim to have ransacked an enemy town for some nice booty. Sounds plausible, only somehow they didn't lose a single man, but, on the contrary, have returned in bigger numbers. Ah well.

Timed events:

Name:
hum bonus
Message:
The town's chief Necromancer announces he's discovered a way to raise more dead and save money at the same time. What a supremely lucky turn of events, conclude you.

Message:
A neighbor lord comes to visit you, claiming he's got a debt to return. You don't remember lending him a thing, but it would be too silly to refuse free money and troops, even for you.

Name:
human bonus
Message:
A leprechaun you met on your morning walk insists you accept his cache and disappears before you can open the pot. It's full of newly minted coins and shiny jewelry. What a decent little creature. Oh, and you meet some volunteers on your way back home. What a day!
