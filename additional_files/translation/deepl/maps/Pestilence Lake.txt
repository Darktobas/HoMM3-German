===== Map description =====
Pestilence Lake is located in a valley deep in a foreboding mountain range.  You have always felt your lack of neighbors was an advantage to your location.  Recently several Lords have moved into the area.  Now they are trying to push you out.  You plan to shove them out instead!

Intro
Message:
You originally moved to Pestilence Lake to get away from the rest of the world.  Several months ago, to your annoyance, you discovered you had a new neighbor.  You ignored your new neighbor, hoping he would ignore you also.  Then last week your scouts told you another Lord had moved into the area.  Your scouts also found both your new neighbors are amassing armies for war.  So it's war they want!  You'll drive them both from the mountains and reclaim your peace and quiet.
