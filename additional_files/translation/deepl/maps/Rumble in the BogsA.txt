Name:
Intro Part 1
Message:
You have always lived a peaceful life, humbly coexisting with your neighbor in a modest coastal region of the world whose most interesting feature was that it was bordered by a deep, dreary marshland.

Name:
Intro Part 2
Message:
One day, much to everyone's surprise, a traveler emerged from the swamp, telling a tale not only of riches within the marsh, but of an even more fantastic land on the other side!  Eager to learn more, you sent scouts into the swamp, but they never returned.

Name:
Intro Part 3
Message:
At first you thought the scouts were lost, but then a thought occurred to you. Perhaps the land across the swamps was SO fantastic that the scouts refused to leave? You share your idea with your neighbor, and he agrees with you.

Name:
Intro Part 4
Message:
Before you quite realize what is happening, you find yourself agreeing to an alliance to seize these fantastic lands and divide them between you and your neighbor.
