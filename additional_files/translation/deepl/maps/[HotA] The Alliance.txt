I'm collecting unique animals for my zoo. I've got many different creatures, but still I don't have Crystal Dragons. There is a dwelling of those north from here. Get me one, and I will reward you.
Wow! That's exactly what I needed. As I've said before, there are many creatures in my zoo. Among those are Faerie Dragons. They breed very well, and I can give you a few in exchange for one Crystal Dragon.
