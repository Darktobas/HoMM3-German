Golems Aplenty

===== Map description =====
The wizards to the south have finally left their valley after a millennium of experimenting with golems.  This leaves the local warring lords an opportunity to move in and grab the generators.  If you can become the first lord to amass enough golems, you will have a definite advantage.
