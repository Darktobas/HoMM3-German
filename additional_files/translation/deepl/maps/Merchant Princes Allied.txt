Name:
Opening
Message:
You and your ally cannot take incessant whining of your fellow merchants any more, and you feel the need to silence them.  Removing the competition will not only stabilize prices but also give your tender ears a rest from the constant bickering.  You do not feel guilt over your decision, for your god is the almighty gold coin.
