Opening Text
Message:
For aeons your kingdom has been at the whims and mercy of the people from Shadoor, a world much like your own, but with vastly different sensibilities.  They have treated your people with nothing but comtempt and you have had enough.  There is another king here in Gelea who wishes to conquer the Shadoor just as much as you do, but he is simply out for conquest.  You, on the other hand, want pure and simple revenge.  You cannot allow the Shadoor to defeat you, nor can you allow your rival to take over as well.  To this end, you are forced to conquer all, else you live out your days as a slave.  A slave you shall be no longer.

Half buried in the swamp is an old royal carriage that appears to have been here for some time.  You search it and find that there is a small amount of gold and jewels still inside.  Obviously whatever thieves robbed it failed to capture the treasures they sought.
